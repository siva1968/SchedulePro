[MISSING: Meeting URL/Link]
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

Upon investigation, the issue was found in the email templates:

1. **Meeting URLs were being generated correctly** ✅
   - Database showed bookings with proper `meeting_url` and `meeting_provider`
   - Backend logic was correctly generating meeting links (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.)

2. **Email templates were missing meeting URL section** ❌
   - HTML email templates did not include the meeting URL display
   - Text email templates had the meeting URL but HTML versions didn't
   - Both customer confirmation and host notification emails were affected

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Customer Confirmation Email Template**

**File:** `apps/api/src/email/email.service.ts` - `sendBookingConfirmation()` method

**Added meeting URL section to HTML template:**
```typescript
${booking.meetingUrl ? `
<div class="meeting-link" style="background-color: #dbeafe; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; margin: 15px 0; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1e40af;">🔗 Join Your Meeting</h4>
  <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Meeting Platform:</strong> ${this.getMeetingProviderName(booking.meetingUrl)}</p>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><a href="${booking.meetingUrl}" style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; text-decoration: none; background-color: #3b82f6; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; border-radius: 6px; display: inline-block;">🎥 Join Meeting</a></p>
  <p style="margin: 5px 0; font-size: 12px; color: #6b7280;">Click the button above or copy this link: ${booking.meetingUrl}</p>
</div>
` : ''}
```

### **2. Enhanced Host Notification Email Template**

**File:** `apps/api/src/email/email.service.ts` - `sendBookingNotificationToHost()` method

**Added meeting URL section for hosts:**
```typescript
${booking.meetingUrl ? `
<div class="meeting-link" style="background-color: #dbeafe; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; margin: 15px 0; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1e40af;">🔗 Meeting Details</h4>
  <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Meeting Platform:</strong> ${this.getMeetingProviderName(booking.meetingUrl)}</p>
  <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Meeting Link:</strong> <a href="${booking.meetingUrl}" style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: bold;">${booking.meetingUrl}</a></p>
</div>
` : ''}
```

**Updated text content for hosts:**
```typescript
${booking.meetingUrl ? `Meeting Link: ${booking.meetingUrl} (${this.getMeetingProviderName(booking.meetingUrl)})` : ''}

${booking.meetingUrl ? `
MEETING DETAILS:
Platform: ${this.getMeetingProviderName(booking.meetingUrl)}
Join Link: ${booking.meetingUrl}
` : ''}
```

### **3. Added Debug Logging**

Enhanced debugging to track meeting URL presence in booking objects:
```typescript
console.log('📧 DEBUG - MEETING URL IN BOOKING OBJECT:', booking.meetingUrl);
console.log('📧 DEBUG - MEETING PROVIDER IN BOOKING OBJECT:', booking.meetingProvider);
```

## 🧪 **Verification Steps**

1. **Database Verification** ✅
   ```sql
   SELECT id, meeting_provider, meeting_url, is_host_created, created_at 
   FROM bookings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   Result: Recent bookings show proper meeting URLs generated

2. **Backend Flow Verification** ✅
   - Meeting URLs are generated after booking creation
   - Booking object is updated with meeting URL before emails are sent
   - Both host and customer emails use the same booking object

3. **Email Template Testing** ✅
   - HTML templates now include meeting URL section
   - Text templates already had meeting URL (no changes needed)
   - Conditional display - only shows if meeting URL exists
