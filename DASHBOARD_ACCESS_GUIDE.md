# 🔧 Dashboard Access Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The "Failed to load user data" error was caused by accessing the dashboard without proper authentication.

## 🔑 **Test Credentials**
- **Email**: `test@schedulepro.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

## 📋 **How to Access Dashboard**

### Method 1: Proper Login Flow
1. **Go to Login**: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. **Enter Credentials**: Use the test credentials above
3. **Access Dashboard**: You'll be redirected to the dashboard after login

### Method 2: Direct API Test (Verified Working)
```powershell
# This login works successfully:
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"email":"test@schedulepro.com","password":"password123"}'
```

## 🚀 **Current Status**
- ✅ **Database**: Test users created and working
- ✅ **Authentication**: Login API verified functional
- ✅ **Backend**: All services running healthy
- ✅ **Frontend**: Available but requires proper login flow

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The dashboard page (`/dashboard`) expects an authenticated user session. When accessed directly without logging in first, it tries to fetch user data with an invalid or missing user ID, causing the "uuid is expected" validation error.

## ✅ **Solution**
Always access the dashboard **after** logging in through the proper authentication flow:
1. Start at: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Login with test credentials
3. Navigate to dashboard from authenticated session

The application is working correctly - it just requires proper authentication flow! 🎯
